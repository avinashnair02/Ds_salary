You\\'ll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n3+ years of engineering experience\\r\\nThings move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar\\r\\nThis will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional experience with Python data tools\\r\\nOur data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies\\r\\nWe use the best tool for the job around here.

To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures\\r\\nIZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasic Linux skills\\r\\nIn order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We\\'ll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbility to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests\\r\\nIZEA\\'s Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcellent verbal and written communications skills\\r\\nRegular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued\\r\\n\\r\\nData Science Background\\r\\nWhile not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nFront End development experience\\r\\nFrom time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon Web Services, or other cloud providers\\r\\nIZEA\\'s software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuous Integration & Deployment\\r\\nIZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.\\r\\n\\r\\nGitHub\\r\\nAll of IZEA\\'s code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github\\'s features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nJIRA\\r\\nIZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout IZEA:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace.
